A hero is the base of each character. The hero holds everything about a character outside a match, and is used to create the character for inside a match.
Look at the Hero class to see what all is needed to make up a hero, as if you leave anything out it could really mess stuff up.
If you find anything is left out, or needs changed, let me know asap.
